# divc_labs

Python notebook templates and modules specific to CUED Division C lab experiments, that utilise pydvma.

## divc_labs

The labs currently supported are:

* M1 (second year)
* 3C6 (third year)
* A general template is provided for research use

## Structure

A copy of the files is kept on a division c fileserver, accessed by bat files on the local dataloggers which copy fresh templates to the student user accounts.
