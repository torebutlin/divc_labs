    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "-  To explore nonlinear effects due to high forcing amplitudes about resonance in mechanical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To construct a model to explain the nonlinear behaviour of the mechanism provided and use this model to simulate the behaviour of the system under specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate use of the sonogram (time-varying spectrum) as an analytical tool to distinguish both frequency and temporal characteristics of a transient record.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many instances a linear model is sufficient to approximate the behaviour of physical systems. However, in particular instances the linear model breaks down and a model with further complexity must be used. We will use the principles of nonlinear vibration theory described in the lectures to model the observed behaviour of a clamped-clamped beam subjected to high driving forces about the primary resonance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment is in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A:** Measurement of the vibratory response of a clamped-clamped beam to variable drive forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B:** Modelling and simulation of the nonlinear system in MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should describe the key results of the experiment, with plots when appropriate. A number of specific questions need to be addressed. The completed report should be securely tied together if it has loose pages, and attached to a completed coursework feedback coversheet. It should then be handed in via the white post-box outside room BE3-39 on the third floor of the Baker building or delivered to Hilde Fernandez in the Div C office before the final lecture of Michaelmas term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "The apparatus comprises of a thin aluminium beam clamped at two ends to prevent axial displacement. Such a system exhibits a spring hardening effect (comment as to why this is the case in your report) with growing displacement amplitude for sufficiently large force inputs. A shaker is used to apply driving forces to the structure. The shaker derives its input from a PC-generated sine-wave (filtered by a low-pass filter) that can be varied in both frequency and amplitude. A National Instruments Data Acquisition Card (NI-DAQ) converts the specified signal to an analogue output, which is low-pass filtered, passed through channel 1 of an oscilloscope, and power-amplified by a current amplifier which provides the input to the shaker. An accelerometer is placed at the centre of the beam to measure the response of the structure to the applied drive input. The accelerometer output is coupled to an amplifier whose output is captured by the NI-DAQ using a Python package that this notebook uses and is described below. The PC will be used to drive the shaker and capture data from the accelerometer. Measurement data will be saved to your teaching system drive where it will be analysed and used for comparison with simulation. If you choose, you can analyse the data at any PC connected to the teaching system."

    "    In the above equation, the natural frequency p and damping coefficient  are given directly by the results of circle-fitting from your first test. Don’t forget that p is in radians/s. At a given point in a sweep, the forcing signal takes the form f (t) acos(t ) , where  represents an arbitrary phase of the input signal, a is the chosen amplitude in voltage units (1 V for the first experiment describing the linear case), and  is a scaling factor which describes the ratio of calibration factors for the two channels of measurement (acceleration and force). Using your values for natural frequency p and damping coefficient  , estimate the value of the scaling factor  from the peak output level from the time-series data in your first experiment (for which nonlinear terms can be neglected). Remember that your data is recording acceleration rather than displacement.\n",

A short section of the time history is copied and Fourier analysed — “Time window for FFT 1”. Then a section of the same length starting a little later in time is copied and analysed similarly (“FFT 2”), then another and another until a sufficient length of the whole time history has been covered.\n",

    "    By plotting in some suitable way this sequence of frequency spectra, we can now look at the response as a function of BOTH frequency and time (in much the same way that your brain processes sounds which you hear). To apply this to the logged experimental data: first load the MAT file; then select channel 2 only (accelerometer signal); then use “Options—Calculate sonogram”. Parameters for sonogram analysis are specified in a menu window. You are asked to provide values for three parameters:\n",

Frequency appears along the horizontal axis. Contours of energy in the signal are plotted in this time/frequency plane. The contours are logarithmically spaced, initially at 5 dB intervals. You should experiment with the number of contours (suggested\n",
