    "\n",
    "In this experiment you will measure natural frequencies of vibrating beams after impulsive loading, and use these to calculate material properties. The frequency of free vibration of beams depends on the density (the inertia) and the stiffness: low density and high stiffness mean higher frequencies. The stiffness of beams in turn depends on the geometry (the length and cross-sectional shape) and the material (the Young’s modulus). The decay rate of the vibrations also provides information on damping i.e. energy loss during vibration. Two materials will be considered: aluminium alloy and the polymer PMMA."
