    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimental modal analysis is a modern technique of vibration investigation which has become very popular. Provided the modal overlap of a system is low, it is reasonably straightforward to recognise resonances by peaks in the vibration response and to map out the corresponding mode shapes by determining how the amplitude and phase of that modal contribution varies over the surface of the system. This information can be used to validate theoretical models of the structure, or to allow design modifications to be undertaken on a rational basis when a vibration problem has to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual method is to measure transfer functions from a grid of points distributed over the system. One envisages applying a force at a fixed point and measuring the vibration response (displacement, velocity or acceleration) at the grid of points. In practice, it is often easier to take advantage of the reciprocal theorem: a fixed sensor, usually an accelerometer, is used, and force is applied to the structure at each of the grid points using a force-transducer hammer. This is the approach to be used in this experiment. The system you will use has much in common with commercial modal analysers, but you will be required to do certain stages by hand rather than having the computer do everything automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should describe the key results of the experiments, with plots where appropriate. A number of specific questions to be addressed are contained in the detailed instructions in Section 4. Your completed report should be submitted online as a PDF file using the 4C6 Moodle page before the last lecture of term when a feedback session on the experiment will be held."

    "\n",
    "The apparatus comprises a thin metal plate fixed around part of its perimeter to a heavy base-plate; an instrumented hammer to apply controlled forces to it; a sensor to measure the response; a datalogging computer provided with suitable analysis software; and some miscellaneous electronic instrumentation. The shape of the thin plate is based on the floor panel of a helicopter — a rounded nose, two doorways, and a tail section. Force can be applied to the structure impulsively, using an instrumented hammer. This has a piezoelectric force transducer built in to it, so that the precise waveform of force can be determined. The signal from this transducer is buffered by a suitable amplifier. Vibration response is measured using an accelerometer fixed to the plate near one of the ''doorways''. The signal from this also passes through a suitable buffer amplifier. The signals corresponding to the force and the acceleration response go to the PC, which is used to perform\n",

    "If the computer is not already on, switch it on, then log in using your usual Teaching System ID and password. If the power is not on, the switch for the computer is on a pillar at the north end of the bench, and the switch for the bench apparatus is somewhere on the central white trunking: follow the wires back to find the correct place. **You may need to plug in the two BNC cables** carrying your input and output signals to the diecast box on the bottom shelf of the computer trolley. Your cables are labelled “4C6 CH1” and “4C6 CH2”, to be plugged into the corresponding channels."

Now select ''Mode Fitting'' and press ''Fit'', and the logger will work through all 12 channels, trying to fit a single frequency and damping factor for the dataset, and amplitude and phases for each position.

    "You know that a given mode manifests itself in all of your measured transfer functions and moreover that it should in theory always have the same frequency and damping factor, but the amplitude will vary from place to place (make sure you know why). If certain sets show poor fits, then something has gone wrong with the fitting procedure. Look at the data carefully in any such cases. Most often, this problem arises when the relevant peak in the transfer function is very tiny, implying that the corresponding point on the structure is near to a node line of that mode. This is useful to know for sketching mode shapes later on. In other cases, the problem may arise because the optimisation routine used to fit the modal parameters has not converged. Try taking a slightly different frequency range and repeating the calculation. If the problem won't go away then simply ignore any rogue data for the purposes of forming your damping factor estimate."

As an example, we can suppose that the helicopter of which this is the floor panel normally operates at an engine speed such that the gearbox provides narrow-band drive in the frequency range 350–500 Hz. If a resonance in the floor panel is excited, this causes discomfort to the pilot and is undesirable. It is thus desired to modify the panel so as to have the widest possible gap in the sequence of resonant frequencies around the range specified. \n",

You can attach any or all of them to the panel. From your calculated mode shapes, explain how you could choose suitable positions for these added masses to achieve the design goal. Try the magnets in your suggested placement, and repeat the measurement of one suitable transfer function to see the effect on the resonant frequencies. Experiment with the number of masses and their positions to find the best arrangement. Does the behaviour follow your expectation?"
