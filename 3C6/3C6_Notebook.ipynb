    "4. What are the main advantages and drawbacks of the three approaches to forcing (sinusoidal, random and impulsive)? For each of the three, suggest a type of application for which it might be the best. Think about size, power, method of attachment, test speed, frequency range, signal-to-noise ratio .... Do not fall into the trap of thinking that the 'best' test method is the one which has an input force 'most similar' to the type of forcing in the real application — remember that provided linear theory is applicable, any type of input force should theoretically give the same transfer function.\n",
